= Plugin IO documentation

This section of the documentation provides a list of the properties and methods used in IO’s PHP classes. The classes are sorted according to the namespaces in which they are used; each namespace lists its classes alphabetically. Only public and protected methods are listed in this section; private methods are not documented.

You can use the version control in the upper right corner to select the IO version you are working with.

Please note that the plugin documentation is not yet comprehensive; we are continuously working on closing the existing documentation gaps.
